This example benchmark is adopted from the REANA Hello World Demo. The workflow has a single step that takes a text file with person names as input, together with a greeting phrase, and a sleep time. For each name in the input file a greeting will be written to an output file that is the concatenation of the greeting phrase and the name. For the purpose of this demo the result file is then analyzed to compute a score for every workflow run. Analysis computes the number of distinct 3-grams in the output file. The overall score is the number of 3-grams divided by the number of lines in the output file. The goal is to achieve a high score.
